# Practical C Programming - Tuned examples with more comments

This is my working space with code examples from my own copy of the great book Practical C Programming, 1st ed, february 2020, written by Bintu Harwani. 
For his original code examples, visit https://www.packtpub.com/support/code-downloads. 

At the very moment, not much code is revised and updated, but as I struggle through the pages I'll add comments to all examples I get over and try to make the 
examples more readable and updated to modern compilers without generating warnings when compiled. 

I'm using Linux Mint 20.3 Uma with GCC 11.1 and VS Code
